TMUX Status
===========


This is a small script which changes the TMUX status-line depending on the fact
that we are online or offline. The status-line format is defined (and
hardcoded) in the script itself. So it will replace your own status-line if you
decide to use it. Maybe, if I feel like it I will make this more configurable.

It mainly exists on github to keep track of my changes, and to provide it to
anyone who may find this useful as well.
